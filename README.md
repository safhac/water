# Water 

(Project in the making)

My take on water and ripple effects in canvas
Started learning canvas a few days ago because I wanted to do some cool effect

After realizing that pixel wrangling isn't for browsers 
I finally came up with a basic algorithm that will create the desired effect

Code need to be refactored:
--------------------------
Fix re-running (i'm new to canvas)
Clean up code 



Create an interface to control:
-------------------------------
Time
Wave height
Wave thickness
Number of ripples
